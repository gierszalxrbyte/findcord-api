## Credits!

- `id.json` - An account that gathers our information via an API request. (If you block the account, findcord won't be able to find you.)
- `servers.json` - Since the server lists followed by findcord are compiled with information from its own server, a big thanks to jarvenox.
- `fetchUserProfile.js` - Not much going on here, you can fetch the information by sending a mutual_guild request. (found by the kayzen)
